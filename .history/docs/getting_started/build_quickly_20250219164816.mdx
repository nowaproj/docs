In this quick-start guide, we'll build a simple app together in under 5 minutes. Cool right?
The app will be a countdown timer where the user enters a value in seconds, presses start, and sees the countdown begin. A progress bar will visually display the countdown.

## What You'll Learn

- Creating a UI with a **Text**, **Progress Bar**, **Button**, and **TextField**
- Defining and updating variables dynamically
- Using Circuit to implement countdown logic with a **Timer** object

Follow along step by step, and try to replicate the process in your own project!

## Step 1: Create the UI

First, let's build the app's interface:

1. Add a **TextField** – This is where users will enter the countdown value.
2. Add a **Text** widget – It will display the current countdown value.
3. Add a **Progress Bar** – This will visually represent the countdown progress.
4. Add a **Button** labeled "Start" – This will start the countdown when clicked.

## Step 2: Make the Countdown Functional

Now, let's bring our app to life by making the **Start** button work.

### Define Variables

We need two integer variables:

- `originalTimer` – Stores the initial countdown value.
- `currentTimer` – Starts at `originalTimer` and decreases by 1 every second.

### Connect Variables to UI

- Set the **Text** widget to display `currentTimer`, so it updates in real-time.
- Set the **Progress Bar**'s value to `currentTimer / originalTimer`, ensuring it starts full (1) and decreases over time.

### Implement Countdown Logic

1. Select the **Start** button and open its **On Pressed** event.
2. Use the **Timer** object to call a function every **1 second**.
3. Inside the function:
    - Decrease `currentTimer` by **1**.
    - Call **Refresh** to update the UI (Text and Progress Bar).

Now, when you click **Start**, the timer will begin counting down, and the progress bar will decrease accordingly.

## Step 3: Allow Users to Set a Custom Timer

We want users to enter a new countdown value instead of using the default one.

### Use a TextField Controller

- The **TextField** widget has something called `Controller`. This is used to access it's properties during the logic building, and do things like clearing the text up.
- When you drop a TextField widget, you will find next to the controller property `text`, which is the controller name created by default
- We will access that `text` controller to retrieve the value entered by the user.

### Set the New Timer Value

1. Open the **On Editing Complete** event for the **TextField**. This event will be called when user finish entering a value inside the TextField, like when the user click enter after typing inside the TextField
2. Add a **Parse()** node to convert the entered text (String) into an integer. (the text property of the TextField is always with the type String even if the user types a number, so we need Parse node to parse it into an integer)
3. Store the result in a new variable (`newValue`): The result from Parse can be stored in a new variable on the spot. We will use that new variable in the next step when setting a new value for the variables we created earlier
4. Set both `currentTimer` and `originalTimer` to `newValue`. This will make the variables hold the most recent value that the user typed in the TextField

Now, when the user enters a new value and presses **Enter**, the countdown will reset to that value. When they press **Start**, it will count down from the new number.
