# Introduction to Nowa


Welcome to the future of building great apps! We are here to help you create ambitious, high-quality Flutter apps faster and more enjoyably than pure coding alone. This Introduction page will guide you through the basics of what Nowa is, how it can help you, and how you can get started building with it.

## How can Nowa help you building that great app?


1. **Freedom in Design**

Enjoy a design experience similar to professional design tools like Figma. With the Nowa Designer tools, you can quickly draw and drop elements on a design board with complete freedom. Once your design is ready, you can instantly make it functional without the need for writing UI code.

  
1. **Building Advanced Logic**

Nowa Circuit, our visual logic editor, allows you to build complex app behavior with just a few clicks. It’s intuitive and powerful, enabling you to create deeply customized logic that suits your app’s unique needs.


2. **Powerful Architecture**

As your app grows, Nowa helps you maintain a clean, scalable structure. Global states, global functions, and other architectural features keep your app organized, reducing complexity when your app becomes more advanced.

  

3. **Flutter-Based**

All apps created in Nowa use Flutter, the powerful open-source framework that lets you deploy to mobile (Android, iOS), web, or desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) from a single codebase.

  

4. **Use Code with Full Freedom**

You can write or modify any part of your code without limitations. You can develop in Nowa and your local IDE side by side with what we call "Hybrid Approach", with changes syncing instantly for a smooth, flexible workflow.

  

5. **Use Nowa on Web and Desktop**

With Nowa’s desktop version, you can create local projects, run them on your simulators or physical devices, and utilize your usual IDE and tools at the same time.

  

6. **Clean Generated Code**

The code Nowa generates is clean, readable, and primarily based on Flutter’s native components, ensuring high performance and easy maintenance.
