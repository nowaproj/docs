For instance, if your app is playing music, a variable could change the play button to a pause button when the music starts.\nPrivacy: They are private to the part of the app where they're created.

They're like the information on a name tag that tells other parts of your app what this screen or component is supposed to display or work with.\nExample: If you have a screen that shows blog articles, parameters might include the article's title, content, and images. These are passed into the screen so it knows what to display.\nExample:\nLet's say your app has a screen for displaying blog posts.
