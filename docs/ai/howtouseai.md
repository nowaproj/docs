# How to use Nowa AI

**When you first open the AI tool**, you’ll be greeted with a clean workspace—no attachments, ready for you and the AI to begin creating.

## Features

### Smart Selection & Context

**How it works:** When you select a screen or widget in your app, it automatically gets added as an attachment to your AI conversation. This gives the AI precise context about what you're working on.

**If you select a text or icon in the widget tree**, the AI chat panel will recognize it and display the context in the lower-left corner.

### Attach screens, widgets

Tell the AI what you'd like to edit, and it can apply changes directly to an entire screen or to individual widgets across your app.

**Simply click the Attach button** in the AI chat panel and then select what you want to attach.
