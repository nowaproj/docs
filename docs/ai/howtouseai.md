# Attachements

We built the AI to know where to find what you want to change, but if you know where to find it, attaching it makes the outcome more precise.

# Smart Selection & Context

When you click on a screen or widget in your app, it’s automatically added as context to your AI conversation.  

This means the AI knows exactly what part of your app you’re focusing on—so when you ask for changes, the results are precise.  

For example, if you select a text or an icon in the widget tree, the AI panel will instantly recognize it and show the context in the lower-left corner.

## Attaching Screens

Just like **smart selection and context**, you can attach screens to give the AI more detail.  

The difference is that here you can **attach multiple full screens** — but **individual widgets can’t be attached this way**.

Simply click the **Attach** button in the AI chat panel, then pick what you’d like to attach.

## Attaching Images

Want the AI to design something based on a picture you have in mind?  

You can attach images, and the AI will use them as inspiration—whether that’s generating similar widgets, pages, or just adding extra context.  

Here’s how:  

1. Click the **Attach** button in the AI panel.  
2. Select **Attach Image**.  
3. Choose the image from your computer.

## Attaching text file

Want the AI to design or build something based on written content you already have?  

You can attach text files, and the AI will use them as input—whether that’s generating similar content, creating structure from it, or adding extra context.  

Here’s how:  

1. Click the **Attach** button in the AI panel.  
2. Select **Attach text File**.  
3. Choose the text file from your computer.

# Reverting and Replaying Changes

If you didn’t like the AI’s last change, you can click **Revert changes** below the message to go back to the previous state. 

And if you change your mind again, you can click **Replay changes** to redo the action.

# Starting a Fresh Chat

Sometimes you’ll want to start over with a clean slate. 

To begin a brand new conversation with the AI, click **New Chat**.  

This clears the chat history and context, so you can focus on your next idea without distractions.
