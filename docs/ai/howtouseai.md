# How to use Nowa AI

**When you first open the AI tool**, youâ€™ll be greeted with a clean workspaceâ€”no attachments, ready for you and the AI to begin creating.

---

## Features

### Smart Selection & Context

**How it works:** When you select a screen or widget in your app, it automatically gets added as an attachment to your AI conversation. This gives the AI precise context about what you're working on.

**If you select a text or icon in the widget tree**, the AI chat panel will recognize it and display the context in the lower-left corner.

### Attach screens, widgets

Tell the AI what you'd like to edit, and it can apply changes directly to an entire screen or to individual widgets across your app.

**Simply click the Attach button** in the AI chat panel and then select what you want to attach.

### Attach images

You can attach images, allowing the AI to generate similar pages, widgets, or provide context.

1. Click the **Attach** button in the AI panel.  
2. Select **Attach Image** from the list.  
3. Choose the image from file explorer.

### Safe Experimentation

If you don't like what the AI generated, you can easily undo and go back to the previous version.

### Fresh Starts

Begin a new chat session to explore different ideas without carrying over previous conversation context.

ðŸ‘‰ **Benefit:** Gives you a clean slate for entirely new creative directions.
