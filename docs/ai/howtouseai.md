# What is Nowa AI?

**Nowa AI** is your assistant for building apps. It helps you make widgets, design pages, connect APIs, and supports you from start to finish.

---

# How to Use Nowa AI

## Usage & Credits

You can see the input and output tokens used for each chat message—along with the cost per prompt.

If you click **Session Details**, you can view it in a more visual way.

You can see exactly how many credits you’ve used over time if you click **Global Usage**.

Credits are now calculated based on **token usage**, not per message. This means:

- A small design tweak (e.g., editing a widget) might cost **0.05–0.1 credits**.  
- A full page or feature build might cost around **1 credit**.

# Custom Instructions

This is useful if you want every prompt to start with a **base instruction**, like:  

- “Make your code structured.”  
- “Always use images from a specific website.” 

Click Options in the **AI panel**, select **Custom Instructions**, add your base instructions in the text field, and click **Save**.

Now, every prompt you send will include these base instructions by default.

# Attachments 

We built the AI to know where to find what you want to change, but if you know where to find it, attaching it makes the outcome more precise.

## Smart Selection & Context

When you click on a screen or widget in your app, it’s automatically added as context to your AI conversation.  

This means the AI knows exactly what part of your app you’re focusing on—so when you ask for changes, the results are precise.  

For example, if you select a text or an icon in the widget tree, the AI panel will instantly recognize it and show the context in the lower-left corner.

## Attaching Screens

Just like **smart selection and context**, you can attach screens to give the AI more detail.  

The difference is that here you can **attach multiple full screens** — but **individual widgets can’t be attached this way**.

Simply click the **Attach** button in the AI chat panel, then pick what you’d like to attach.

## Attaching Images

Want the AI to design something based on a picture you have in mind?  

You can attach images, and the AI will use them as inspiration—whether that’s generating similar widgets, pages, or just adding extra context.  

Here’s how:  
1. Click the **Attach** button in the AI panel.  
2. Select **Attach Image**.  
3. Choose the image from your computer.

## Attaching Text Files

Want the AI to design or build something based on written content you already have?  

You can attach text files, and the AI will use them as input—whether that’s generating similar content, creating structure from it, or adding extra context.  

Here’s how:  
1. Click the **Attach** button in the AI panel.  
2. Select **Attach Text File**.  
3. Choose the text file from your computer.

# Reverting and Replaying Changes 

If you didn’t like the AI’s changes, you can click **Restore checkpoint** at the start of the message to return to the previous state.

And if you change your mind again, you can click **Replay checkpoint** to redo the action.

This feature also works with **chats in your chat history**, so you can revisit and adjust previous edits anytime.

# Starting a Fresh Chat

Sometimes you’ll want to start over with a clean slate. 

To begin a brand new conversation with the AI, click **New Chat**.  

This clears the chat history and context, so you can focus on your next idea without distractions.

# Chat History 

Your **past chats are saved**, so you can easily revisit and **resume** any conversation whenever you want.  

This makes it easier to pick up where you left off without starting from scratch.

You can easily revisit and continue past conversations by clicking **Options**, selecting **Chat history**, and choosing the chat you want.

<video src="/videos/ai/chathistory.mkv" controls width="100%" />

# Managing Long Prompts and Chats

If your chat gets lengthy, you’ll be asked whether you want to **continue or start fresh**.  

This helps keep conversations focused.
