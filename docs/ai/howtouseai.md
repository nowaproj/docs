# How to Use Nowa AI

Open **Nowa AI**, share your idea, and let the AI help you build your Flutter app.

---

## Smart Selection & Context

**Nowa AI** understands the **context**—we designed it this way for you.

When you click on a screen or widget in your app, it’s automatically added as context to your AI conversation.  

This means the AI knows exactly what part of your app you’re focusing on—so when you ask for changes, the results are precise.  

For example, if you select a text or an icon in the widget tree, the AI panel will instantly recognize it and show the context in the lower-left corner.

## Attaching Screens and Widgets

Sometimes you’ll want to tell the AI, *“Work on this specific thing.”* That’s where attachments come in.  

You can attach an entire screen or just a single widget, and the AI will apply your changes directly there.  

Simply click the **Attach** button in the AI chat panel, then pick what you’d like to attach.  
From there, just describe what you’d like to change, and the AI will do the rest.

## Attaching Images

Want the AI to design something based on a picture you have in mind?  
You can attach images, and the AI will use them as inspiration—whether that’s generating similar widgets, pages, or just adding extra context.  

Here’s how:  

1. Click the **Attach** button in the AI panel.  
2. Select **Attach Image**.  
3. Choose the image from your computer.

## Reverting and Replaying Changes

Made a change you don’t like? Don’t worry.  

Just click **Revert changes**, and everything goes back to how it was before.  

And if you change your mind again, you can click **Replay changes** to redo the action instantly.

## Starting a Fresh Chat

Sometimes you’ll want to start over with a clean slate. 

To begin a brand new conversation with the AI, click **New Chat**.  

This clears the chat history and context, so you can focus on your next idea without distractions.
