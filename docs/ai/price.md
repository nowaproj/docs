# Credits, Limits & Privacy

In Nowa, credits are what let you do chat with the AI, generate features, and turn your app ideas into working products.  

Your plan decides how many credits you get each month, and they refresh automatically. 

If you ever run out, you can upgrade your plan or on the Scale plan, simply add more as you need.
