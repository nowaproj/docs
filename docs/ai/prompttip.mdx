# Prompting Tips

Nowa AI can design, code, and integrate your Flutter app with just a few prompts. The better you guide it, the better your results.

This guide shares practical tips to write prompts that help Nowa AI work faster, avoid mistakes, and deliver what you need.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## 1. Keep it small — one step at a time 

Big, vague prompts can lead to unexpected results. 
Break your requests into smaller, clear steps so the AI can focus and you can quickly review and adjust.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="good" label="Good" default>

```text
Add a search bar to my product list screen.
```
Clear, specific, and actionable.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="risky" label="Bad">

```text
Build me a full shopping app with everything.
```

Too vague and overwhelming for the AI to process effectively.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 2. Attach when it matters 

When modifying something specific, attach that file, screen, or widget to your prompt.  
This gives the AI:

- A precise starting point  
- Faster focus on the relevant code  
- Less chance of unrelated changes  

:::tip 
You don't need to attach all dependencies — just the main element you're working on. If the AI needs more, it will fetch it.
:::

---

## 3. Make attachments as focused as possible 

- If you want to update a specific widget, select **only that widget** — not the entire screen.  
- If Nowa AI needs more context from the surrounding screen, it will go find it.  

 Focused attachments help the AI make better decisions and avoid unnecessary edits.

---

## 4. Give context — reduce assumptions 

AI works best when it understands the bigger picture.  
Context could include:

- The purpose of the screen or feature  
- Key design or functional elements  
- Relevant background or user flow  

The more context you give, the fewer assumptions the AI has to make.

---

## 5. Start a new chat when context drifts

When your next request isn't closely related to the current thread, start a fresh chat.  
Old conversations can bias the AI toward previous topics and decisions.

**Why it helps:**  
- Keeps the AI focused on the current goal 
- Reduces accidental carry-over from older prompts 
- Improves clarity and results — especially when switching features 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="good" label="Good Practice" default>

```text
New chat: Build an 'Orders' screen with filters (status, date).
Attach orders_list.dart. 
```

Clean slate, focused context. 

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="risky" label="Poor Practice">

```text
Same chat about homepage styling: Also add Supabase auth
and reset password. 
```

Mixed contexts lead to confusion. 

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Rule of thumb
Keep a chat to ~5 prompts. If you're switching features or the thread feels unrelated, start a new one and attach the relevant screen/widget.
:::

## 6. Master the Sandwich Technique 

The "prompt sandwich" is a simple but powerful structure: 

1. **Intent** — State what you want to achieve   
2. **Context** — Add relevant background info (bullet points work great)   
3. **Task** — Tell the AI exactly what to do  
4. **Constraints** — Any rules or limits the AI must follow 

### Example: 

```text title="Perfect Prompt Structure"
#Intent 
I want to build a modern homepage for my shoe store app.

#Context 
• Show main promotion at the top 
• Display products in a grid with price and image
• Mobile-first approach 

#Task 
Build the homepage as described above.

#Constraints 
Keep the design clean and modern, and the implementation simple.
```

## 7. Be clear with style & function 

Avoid vague words like "nice" or "beautiful." Instead, be specific:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="specific" label="Specific" default>

- "Use a dark theme with high-contrast text"   
- "Rounded card corners with subtle shadows"  
- "Responsive layout for mobile and web" 

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="vague" label="Vague">

- "Make it look nice" 
- "Add some beautiful styling" 
- "Make it responsive" 

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

## 8. Fixing errors? Just ask! 

Nowa AI can detect and fix errors in your project automatically. 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="specific" label="Specific Error" default>

```text
There's a build error in homepage_screen.dart; please fix it. 
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="general" label="All Issues">

```text
Fix issues in my project
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning Important
Use the "fix all issues" approach only when the total number of issues is small. For larger projects, divide into focused prompts for better results.
:::

It will locate the issue and apply the fix automatically.

##  Bonus tip — Think like a pair programmer

Treat Nowa AI as a collaborator, not just a code generator. 

**Instead of one-way commands, engage in dialogue:** 
- Explain your thought process and requirements 
- Review outputs and provide feedback 
- Iterate together to refine and improve results 
- Ask questions when something isn't clear 

This collaborative approach leads to better outcomes and more maintainable code.
