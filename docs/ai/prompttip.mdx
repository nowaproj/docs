# Prompting Tips

The way you write those prompts makes a big difference. 

The clearer your request, the better the AI can respond — and the fewer corrections you’ll need to make later.  

This guide walks you through practical ways to write effective prompts so you can get the most out of Nowa.  

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## 1. Keep it small — one step at a time 

Asking the AI to do too much at once can create confusion.  
It’s better to keep things focused and manageable. Break your idea into smaller steps so you can review results quickly and adjust as you go.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="good" label="Good" default>

```text
Add a search bar to my product list screen.
```
Clear, specific, and actionable.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="risky" label="Risky">

```text
Build me a full shopping app with everything.
```

Too vague and overwhelming for the AI to process effectively.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 2. Attach when it matters 

When you want to change something specific, attach the related file, screen, or widget to your prompt.  
This gives the AI a clear starting point, keeps it focused, and reduces the chance of editing unrelated code.

:::tip
You don’t have to attach *everything*. Just share the main element you’re working on.  
If the AI needs more context, it will fetch it automatically.
:::

---

## 3. Make attachments as focused as possible 

Think “less is more.”  
If you want to adjust a widget, attach **only that widget** — not the entire screen.  
The AI can always look around for more context if it needs to.

This keeps the edits accurate and avoids accidental changes elsewhere.

---

## 4. Give context — reduce assumptions 

AI does its best work when it understands your goal.  
A little context goes a long way. You can mention:  

- What the screen or feature is for  
- The flow you expect your users to follow  
- Any important design or functional elements  

With context, the AI makes fewer guesses — and delivers closer to what you had in mind.

---

## 5. Start a new chat when context drifts

If your next request isn’t related to the current one, start a fresh chat.  
Old conversations can “carry over” and confuse the AI.

**Why it helps:**  
- Keeps the AI aligned with your new goal  
- Prevents unrelated changes  
- Produces cleaner results when switching features  

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="good" label="Good Practice" default>

```text
New chat: Build an 'Orders' screen with filters (status, date).
Attach orders_list.dart. 
```

Clean slate, focused context.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="risky" label="Risky">

```text
Same chat about homepage styling: Also add Supabase auth
and reset password.
```

Mixed topics lead to confusion.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Rule of thumb
Keep each chat to about **5 prompts**.  
If you’re switching features or the thread feels off-topic, start a new chat and attach the right file.
:::

## 6. Master the Sandwich Technique 

A well-structured prompt is like a sandwich — clear layers that the AI can follow.  

1. **Intent** — What you want to achieve  
2. **Context** — Background or supporting details  
3. **Task** — The specific action for the AI  
4. **Constraints** — Rules or limits to follow  

### Example

```text title="Perfect Prompt Structure"
#Intent
I want to build a modern homepage for my shoe store app.

#Context
• Show main promotion at the top
• Display products in a grid with price and image
• Mobile-first approach

#Task
Build the homepage as described above.

#Constraints
Use a dark theme with high-contrast text
```

---

## 7. Be clear with style & function 

Words like “nice” or “beautiful” can mean very different things.  
The more specific you are, the closer the AI will get to your vision.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="specific" label="Specific" default>

- “Use a dark theme with high-contrast text”  
- “Rounded card corners with subtle shadows”  
- “Responsive layout for mobile and web”

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="vague" label="Vague">

- “Make it look nice”  
- “Add some beautiful styling”  
- “Make it responsive”

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

## 8. Fixing errors? Just ask! 

If your project runs into errors, Nowa AI can repair them for you.  

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="specific" label="Specific Error" default>

```text
There’s a build error in homepage_screen.dart; please fix it.
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="general" label="All Issues">

```text
Fix issues in my project
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning Important
Use the “fix all issues” prompt only when there are just a few errors.  
For bigger projects, handle them step by step for more reliable results.

## Bonus tip — Think like a pair programmer

Nowa AI isn’t just a tool — it’s your teammate.  
The best results come when you work together:  

- Share your reasoning, not just your commands  
- Review the output and give feedback  
- Iterate step by step  
- Ask questions if you’re unsure  

Collaboration makes your app stronger, cleaner, and easier to maintain.
