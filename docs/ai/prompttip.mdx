# Prompting Tips 🚀

Nowa AI can design, code, and integrate your Flutter app with just a few prompts. The better you guide it, the better your results. ✨

This guide shares practical tips to write prompts that help Nowa AI work faster, avoid mistakes, and deliver what you need. 🎯

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## 1️⃣ Keep it small — one step at a time 🔍

Big, vague prompts can lead to unexpected results. 😵  
Break your requests into smaller, clear steps so the AI can focus and you can quickly review and adjust. ⚡

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="good" label="✅ Good" default>

```text
Add a search bar to my product list screen. 🔍
```
Clear, specific, and actionable. 🎯

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="risky" label="❌ Risky">

```text
Build me a full shopping app with everything. 🛒
```

Too vague and overwhelming for the AI to process effectively. 🤯

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 2️⃣ Attach when it matters 📎

When modifying something specific, attach that file, screen, or widget to your prompt. 🎯  
This gives the AI:

- 🎯 A precise starting point  
- ⚡ Faster focus on the relevant code  
- 🔒 Less chance of unrelated changes  

:::tip 💡
You don't need to attach all dependencies — just the main element you're working on. If the AI needs more, it will fetch it. 🔄
:::

---

## 3️⃣ Make attachments as focused as possible 🔬

- If you want to update a specific widget, select **only that widget** — not the entire screen. 📱  
- If Nowa AI needs more context from the surrounding screen, it will go find it. 🕵️‍♂️  

🎯 Focused attachments help the AI make better decisions and avoid unnecessary edits. ✂️

---

## 4️⃣ Give context — reduce assumptions 🧠

AI works best when it understands the bigger picture. 🖼️  
Context could include:

- 🎯 The purpose of the screen or feature  
- 🎨 Key design or functional elements  
- 📋 Relevant background or user flow  

The more context you give, the fewer assumptions the AI has to make. 🤔

---

## 5️⃣ Start a new chat when context drifts 💬

When your next request isn't closely related to the current thread, start a fresh chat. 🆕  
Old conversations can bias the AI toward previous topics and decisions. 🔄

**Why it helps:** 🤝  
- Keeps the AI focused on the current goal 🎯  
- Reduces accidental carry-over from older prompts 🚫  
- Improves clarity and results — especially when switching features ⚡  

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="good" label="✅ Good Practice" default>

```text
New chat: Build an 'Orders' screen with filters (status, date). 📋
Attach orders_list.dart. 📎
```

Clean slate, focused context. ✨

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="risky" label="❌ Poor Practice">

```text
Same chat about homepage styling: Also add Supabase auth 🔐
and reset password. 🔄
```

Mixed contexts lead to confusion. 😵‍💫

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info 📏 Rule of thumb
Keep a chat to ~5 prompts. If you're switching features or the thread feels unrelated, start a new one and attach the relevant screen/widget. 🔄
:::

## 6️⃣ Master the Sandwich Technique 🥪

The "prompt sandwich" is a simple but powerful structure: 💪

1. **Intent** — State what you want to achieve 🎯  
2. **Context** — Add relevant background info (bullet points work great) 📝  
3. **Task** — Tell the AI exactly what to do ⚡  
4. **Constraints** — Any rules or limits the AI must follow 📏  

### Example: 💼

```text title="Perfect Prompt Structure"
#Intent 🎯
I want to build a modern homepage for my shoe store app. 👟

#Context 📝
• Show main promotion at the top 🎉
• Display products in a grid with price and image 🛍️
• Mobile-first approach 📱

#Task ⚡
Build the homepage as described above.

#Constraints 📏
Keep the design clean and modern, and the implementation simple. ✨
```

## 7️⃣ Be clear with style & function 🎨

Avoid vague words like "nice" or "beautiful." Instead, be specific: 📐

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="specific" label="✅ Specific" default>

- "Use a dark theme with high-contrast text" 🌙  
- "Rounded card corners with subtle shadows" 📋  
- "Responsive layout for mobile and web" 📱💻

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="vague" label="❌ Vague">

- "Make it look nice" 😶  
- "Add some beautiful styling" 🤷‍♂️  
- "Make it responsive" 📐

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

## 8️⃣ Fixing errors? Just ask! 🔧

Nowa AI can detect and fix errors in your project automatically. 🛠️

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="specific" label="Specific Error" default>

```text
There's a build error in homepage_screen.dart; please fix it. 🚨
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="general" label="All Issues">

```text
Fix issues in my project 🔧
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning ⚠️ Important
Use the "fix all issues" approach only when the total number of issues is small. For larger projects, divide into focused prompts for better results. 📊
:::

It will locate the issue and apply the fix automatically. ⚡
