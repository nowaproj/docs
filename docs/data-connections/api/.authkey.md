# Authentication key

We make it easier for you by offering two ways to provide the **Authentication key** either directly in the request header or by referencing a stored **Shared Preferences key**.

:::tip
Using Shared Preferences is a good idea if your users is already logged in and you want to validate them with a token. This way, you only need to set it once dynamically, instead of always attaching it to the header from a variable.
