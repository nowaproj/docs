# Creating an API Collection  

Welcome! In this guide, we’ll explore how to set up and configure an API collection using the **lovely Cat API** 🐾. Don’t worry—it’s simple! By the end, you’ll be able to send requests and receive adorable cat pictures 😻.  

We’ll go step by step: create the collection, set the base URL, add your API key, and finally make sure we always get responses in JSON format.

## 📝 Steps  

### 1️⃣ Create the Collection  
Start by creating a new API collection in **Nowa**.

✨ As soon as you create it, Nowa will automatically generate a **Dart file** that contains your API setup. This means your collection is not just a visual setup—it’s already connected to real code you can build upon.

**💡 Why this is good:**  
- 📂 Keeps all your cat-related requests neatly in one place.  
- ⚡ Automatically generates a Dart file, keeping the UI and codebase perfectly in sync.

### 2️⃣ Set the Base URL  
Add the **Base URL** for all your requests:  

```http
https://api.thecatapi.com/
```

**💡 Why this is good:**  
- 🔗 You only need to write the common part of the API once.  
- ✨ Makes new requests shorter, reduces errors, and allows quick updates.

### 3️⃣ Add the API Key  
Go to the **Authorization** section.  
Here, simply type in your API key 🔑 in the Nowa interface.

**💡 Why this is good:**  
- 🔐 Once entered, every request will automatically include your key.  
- 🙌 No more copy-paste—it’s handled for you.

### 4️⃣ Configure the Headers  
Tell the API you want responses in **JSON format**:  

```http
Accept: application/json
```  

👉 Remember:  
- The part **before the colon (`Accept`)** goes into the **Key** field.  
- The part **after the colon (`application/json`)** goes into the **Value** field.

**💡 Why this is good:**  
- 📊 JSON is structured, clean, and easy to work with.  
- 🛠️ Perfect for integrations and application development.
