# Setup Firebase with the project

Watch this video on our Youtube channel to learn the following:

- Create a Firebase project
- Sign in to your Firebase account from Nowa, and let Nowa create the apps for you and also set up the config files for the Flutter project
- Enable Firebase Authentication in Firebase and Nowa
- Enable Authentication providers, which are Email and Password, and Sign in with Google
- Adding SHA fingerprint in case you need to use Google sign in for an Android app. 

:::note
The tutorial below made with the older version of Nowa (Nowa V1). There might be slight differences in building the logic. If you have a question feel free to ask us on our Discord or online community, or shoot us an email at team@nowa.dev
