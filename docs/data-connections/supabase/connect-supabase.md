# Connect

Welcome! Let‚Äôs get your app connected to Supabase ‚Äî an open-source toolkit that provides authentication (manage user sign-ups, logins, and permissions), file storage (store and serve images, videos, and documents), a database (powerful Postgres with an API out of the box), and row-level security (define who can insert, update, or delete rows).
