# Streams

## (Optional) Step: Stream - Realtime Query

In **Supabase**, you can enable Streams on a table (e.g., to-dos) to get real-time updates. When querying, run it as a **Stream** to keep your data live.

First, you need to select the table you want in the **Table Editor**. Then, you can enable **Stream queries** by clicking **Enable Realtime**, and then clicking **Enable Realtime** again.

Now you can use **Nowa AI** to make **queries** as a **Stream**—just ask for it to be **Stream**—and when running the query and updating the table, the panel will update live.
