# Instant Preview Share

As you might know, you can already [deploy your app to the App store](./ios-deploy.md), [play store or Android in general](./android-deploy.md) or [Web](./web-deploy.mdx), but deplopyment is usually suitable for final stages of testing and deploying the final app, but what about testing?

It would be usually hard to build and share artifacts everytime you wanted to get feedback from your users, team members or stalkholders, but there's another way that is more suitable for testing, which is **Instant Preview Share** 

Instant Preview Share lets you share a **fully interactive preview of your app as a link**, without building, deploying, hosting, or sending files, and without the recievers having to do anything beside opening the link in a browser.

Instead of asking others to download an app to their devices, or wait for a build to be able to share, the shared link allows your app to opens **directly in the browser** inside a preview frame that loads instantly showing a full preview for the app.

Since frequent testing and feedback is key for building successful products, instant sharing make doing that easy and effortlessly

## How it works

1. Click the **Play** button to run your app inside Nowa  
2. Click **Share**  
3. Choose how you want to share the preview:
   - **Public** – Anyone with the link can view the preview  
   - **Private** – Only members of the workspace with project access can view it  
4. Share the preview using one of the following options:
   - **Copy link** – Share the preview link directly  
   - **QR Code** – Let others open the preview by scanning a QR code  
5. To see exactly what others will see, click **Open in your browser**

That’s it — no build step and no waiting.

:::tip[Always in sync]
The preview link always stays connected to your project.  
Any change you make to the app is reflected instantly using the **same link**, without generating a new one.

## Preview on different devices

Anyone opening the preview link can switch between different device previews from the right side, including:
- iPhone  
- iPad  
- Android  
- Web  
- Desktop (macOS)  

This helps reviewers understand how the app behaves across devices, all from a single preview link.
