# Introduction to Nowa

Welcome to **Nowa** — the fastest way to build **production-ready Flutter apps** using **AI** and **visual building** from start to finish,  
without needing to know Flutter or write code.

Our mission is simple:  
help you build high-quality, scalable apps in less time, with less stress, and with more creativity.

---

## What is Nowa?

**Nowa** is an all-in-one platform that lets you design, build, and deploy Flutter apps visually or with AI — or both.  
You can create complete, production-ready apps without worrying about setup, syntax, or Flutter complexity.  

Nowa combines three powerful layers:  

- 🧠 **AI built for Flutter** — not a generic model, but an AI agent optimized to generate, structure, and scale clean Flutter code automatically.  
- 🎨 **Visual building** — design and edit any UI or logic visually with a Figma-like designer and a flow-chart-based logic editor called **Circuit**.  
- 💻 **Full code freedom** — access, edit, or extend the generated Flutter code anytime, with 1-click preview or instant source download.

## Why Nowa is Different

Most app builders either give you visual freedom without real code, or code generation without structure.  
Nowa gives you both — **clean code and total flexibility** — backed by an AI that truly understands Flutter.

Here’s what makes Nowa stand out:

### 🤖 AI Specialized for Flutter
Nowa’s AI agent doesn’t just produce working code — it builds **clean, scalable Flutter architecture** by itself.  
You don’t need to guide it with complex prompts.  
Keep your requests simple (“Add a login screen with Firebase”), and Nowa’s AI handles the details, following Flutter best practices automatically.

### 🧩 Visual Building at Its Best
Build your entire app visually — from UI to logic — with the freedom to switch between AI, visual, and code at any time.  
The designer works like **Figma**, but what you build is **real Flutter UI**, not mockups.  
For app logic, use **Circuit**, a visual editor that lets you create logic as flowcharts with the same flexibility as code.

### ⚡ Instant App Preview
Unlike normal Flutter workflows that require building before you can test,  
Nowa lets you click **Play** and instantly see your app running — no simulator or build time required.

### 🧱 Full Source Code & Instant View
View or download your app’s full Flutter source code anytime.  
For local projects, you already have the code on your machine from day one.  
Every screen, model, service, and API integration is real Flutter code — ready to run, scale, or edit.

### 🧼 Clean, Production-Ready Code
The code Nowa generates follows Flutter’s best practices — using native widgets, proper state management, and scalable structure.  
That means you can hand it off to developers, continue development freely, or import it back into Nowa later — without any lock-in.

### 💻 Local Projects & Desktop App
Nowa lets you work fully locally using a **native desktop app** for top performance, speed, and security.  
You can choose between **local** or **cloud projects**, both powered by our interpreter that works directly on real Flutter projects —  
no metadata, no hidden files, just pure code.

### 🔄 Hybrid Workflow
Nowa fits perfectly into your existing setup.  
Open your project in **Nowa** and **VS Code** (or any IDE) at the same time — changes sync instantly both ways.  
You can keep using Git, CLI tools, and your usual developer workflow while still enjoying visual building.

### 🧠 Full Code Control
You never lose flexibility.  
You can:
- Write custom code (functions, widgets, classes, or logic)  
- Add any package from **pub.dev**  
- Edit the generated Flutter files freely — even platform files  
Nowa gives you **the speed of no-code** and **the freedom of full code**.

### 🔗 Powerful Integrations
Quickly connect your app to APIs and data sources like **Firebase**, **Supabase**, **Airtable**, or any REST API.  
Nowa automatically handles setup, data modeling, and error handling — so you can focus on logic, not configuration.

### 🚀 Deploy Anywhere
Deploy your app to the **App Store**, **Play Store**, or **Web** with a single click.  
You can even host web apps directly on Nowa — for testing or production — with custom domains supported.

### 🧠 Templates & Marketplace
Jump-start your project with high-quality **templates** or clone full functional apps from the **Nowa Marketplace**.  
Customize them freely — it’s the fastest way to build real apps.

### 🔧 Git Integration
Whether you work locally or in the cloud, Nowa includes **built-in Git support**.  
Commit, branch, and sync with GitHub to collaborate easily across designers and developers.
