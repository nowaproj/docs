# Introduction to Nowa

We built **Nowa** to make app development easier for you.  

You don’t need to be an expert in Flutter or coding — with Nowa, you can design, build, and publish real apps in a way that feels approachable and clear.  

Our role is to take care of the complex parts in the background so you can stay focused on your ideas.

## What is Nowa?

Nowa is a **visual development environment** for creating Flutter applications.  
It combines AI assistance with a visual editor, so you can work the way that feels most natural to you.  

Here’s what you get:  

- An **AI Assistant** that helps you generate features, connect data, or even build multi-screen flows by describing what you want.  
- A **Visual Editor** where you can design layouts and logic by dragging and dropping.  
- **Exportable Flutter source code** that belongs to you, with no platform lock-in.  
- Built-in **integrations** for services like Firebase, Supabase, Xano, and REST APIs.

## Why use Nowa?

We designed Nowa to support you whether you’re starting fresh or already experienced.  
Instead of worrying about technical setup, you can:  

- Design your app visually.  
- Use AI when you need help with logic or structure.

## What makes Nowa different?

When we created Nowa, we wanted it to feel practical for real app development, not just prototyping. That’s why it includes:  

- **Context-aware AI** that understands your project and applies changes across files.  
- The freedom to **switch between visual editing and AI prompts** whenever it suits you.  
- **Production-ready Flutter code** that is structured, maintainable, and fully yours.  
- An **end-to-end pipeline** that covers design, logic, data handling, testing, and deployment.
