## Step 2: Use Chat to Shape Your App

Now comes the fun part ‚Äî telling Nowa what you want to build.  

With Chat, you simply describe your idea in plain English and let Nowa do the heavy lifting.

1. Click the **Chat** icon on the left.  
2. Type what you‚Äôd like your app to do.  
3. Press **Send** and watch your app take shape.  

Here‚Äôs exactly what we asked Nowa in this example:

```markdown
Create a simple stopwatch app ‚è± in Flutter. It should use only one button to control the stopwatch. The button behavior depends on the current state:

If the stopwatch is idle (0:00 and not running), the button shows 'Start' and starts the stopwatch.

If the stopwatch is running, the button shows 'Stop' and pauses the stopwatch.

If the stopwatch is paused (stopped but not at 0:00), the button shows 'Reset' and resets the stopwatch back to 0:00.
```
