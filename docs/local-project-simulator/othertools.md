# Using Other Tools on a Local Project: Git & IDE

When building your app in **Nowa**, you’re not limited to the built-in editor.  

You can easily bring in **Git** and your favorite **IDE** (like VS Code or IntelliJ) to work alongside Nowa.  

---

## How this can help you:

Let me tell you how:

- In **Nowa**, you design visually, configure features, and manage your app’s structure.  
- In your **IDE**, you dive deeper into the code and handle more advanced customizations.  

Whenever you make a change in one, the other updates instantly.  

You never lose context, and your app keeps moving forward without interruptions.  

---

## How It Works

1. Open your Nowa project locally in your IDE.  
2. Use **Git** just as you normally would — commit, push ⬆, pull ⬇, or switch branches.  
3. Any code changes you make are automatically synchronized with Nowa.  
4. Updates appear in real-time, so your workflow stays smooth and connected.
