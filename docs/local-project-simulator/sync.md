title: Cloud-Local Synchronization

# Cloud-local Synchronization

You can synchronize your local project with the cloud in both directions. 

For example, if you want to work online, you can convert your existing local project into a cloud project. 

Likewise, if you started in the cloud but prefer to work offline, you can download the project and continue locally. 

All changes are fully synchronized, ensuring your work stays up to date everywhere.

## Cloud to Local

Select your **cloud project**, then click **Sync**. Next, click **Browse** to choose the folder where you want to save it, and finally, click **Clone to Local**.

## Synchronize

:::warning

Always use this function carefully. If you synchronize in the wrong direction, you can easily overwrite or delete your work. Double-check the sync direction before clicking **Proceed with Sync**.


:::

Simply click **Sync**, then choose whether to sync **from cloud** or **from local**. 

You’ll see the direction of the sync — cloud to local or local to cloud.

Then click **Proceed with Sync** to start the synchronization.

## Unlink

If you’ve accidentally linked the wrong project, no worries — you can easily fix it! 

Simply click **Sync** and then **Unlink Project**. 

You’ll see which project you’re about to unlink, and after confirming, you’ll be asked if you want to sync with other project.
