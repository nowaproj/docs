# Why local projects

In Nowa, you can choose between **cloud projects** and **local projects**. Both let you build your amazing apps, but they work a bit differently.  

- **Cloud projects**: Everything is online. You can use **Cloud Build** to build for Android, iOS, or Web without setup.  
- **Local projects**: Everything is on your computer. You build manually, but gain more control and flexibility.  

---

## Testing your app

- **Local projects**: Run on real devices or simulators, and use **Hot Reload** to reload changes instantly.  
- **Cloud projects**: You’ll need to download the code or rebuild in the cloud each time you make changes.

## Why pick local?

- **Use your tools**: Keep VS Code, simulators, and Git in your workflow.  
- **Work in both places**: Edit in your IDE and design in Nowa—changes stay in sync.
