# Loading indicator

In this mini tutorial, which is part [Firebase integration series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVhnHv8Cdhz-ymSW3mSG1ciO1HQeIfAEo), you will learn how to display a loading indicator and hide it when loading is done.

We will be using:
- [Circular loading indicator](../ui/widgets/widget_desc/loading_circular.md)
- [Visibility wrapper](../ui/wrappers/visibility.md)

- Creating a [variable](../vars_params_functions/create_variable.mdx) called `isLoggingIn` to hold the state of logging in
