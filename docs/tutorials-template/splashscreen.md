# Splashscreen

Learn how to add a customized splash screen to your app in Nowa with just a few clicks! 

Two things you will learn in this video: 
1. How to display a splash screen for a certain duration before moving to another screen.
2. How to perform background tasks while displaying the splash screen, making it functional and not just aesthetically pleasing.

The background task we are doing is checking the authentication token stored in shared preferences to determine if the app should navigate to the main screen or the login screen, which is a must case for any app that uses API to login.
