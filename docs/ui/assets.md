Assets are essential for bringing your app to life — from custom fonts and icons to images, videos, and sounds.  
In this page, you'll learn how assets work in Nowa and how to manage them efficiently.

## Where to Find Your Assets

All your project assets are located in the **Files panel**, found in the side panel of the Nowa editor.  
The **last section** in this panel is called the **Assets section**, where you can view and manage all files such as images, SVGs, fonts, and audio.

## Importing Assets into Your Project

You can import new assets into your project in three simple ways:

1. **Upload Button** — From the **Assets panel**, click the **Upload** button to browse and select files from your computer.  
2. **Drag and Drop** — Drag files directly from your desktop or file explorer into the design board.  
   They’ll automatically be imported into your project.  
3. **Widget Details Panel** — Some widgets (like the **Image** widget) let you upload files directly from their **Source** property inside the Details panel.

## Removing and Renaming Files

Removing an asset from the canvas doesn’t delete it from the project.  
To permanently remove a file (screen, component, or asset such as an image or font):

- **Right-click** the file in the **Assets panel**  
- Choose **Remove**

To rename a file:
- **Right-click** the file in the **Assets panel**  
- Select **Rename**

:::tip
Keep your asset names simple and clear (for example, `app_logo.png` or `main_font.ttf`).  
It makes managing large projects much easier.
