description: Learn what boards are, how to create them, and how to organize your workspace efficiently in Nowa.

Boards are where you design, organize, and manage your app visually in Nowa.  
They act as workspaces that help you keep your screens, widgets, and assets organized — so you can focus on building your app efficiently.

In this section, you’ll learn:
1. What boards are and what they’re useful for  
2. How to create a new board  
3. How to reopen a closed board

## Understanding Boards

There are several types of boards in Nowa, each serving a specific purpose:

- **Design Boards** — A flexible canvas where you can freely create and arrange your designs.  
  You can include multiple screens and components here.  

- **Widgets Boards** — A focused workspace that opens a single widget or screen at a time,  
  allowing you to dive into its details and structure.  

- **Assets Board** — A view dedicated to inspecting one asset (like an image, SVG, or font) at a time.

## Creating a New Board

To create a new board:
1. Click the **“+”** button at the top of the tabs bar.  
2. Choose the type of board you want to create.  
3. You can also open an existing board from the **“Recent files”** section.

Once created, your board is automatically saved in your **Files panel**,  
and you can easily reopen or delete it later if needed.

You can navigate between different boards using the **tabs** at the top of the interface.

### Board Customization

Using the **Details panel**, you can personalize your board by:
- Changing the **background color**  
- Showing or hiding the **grid**

These customizations make your workspace more comfortable and visually consistent with your design style.

Your settings are automatically saved — so when you reopen a board, your preferences remain.  
Each board has its own settings, allowing you to customize them independently.

## How to Use Boards Efficiently

To get the most out of boards, think of them as separate “desks” for different parts of your project.

Keep related design elements together on the same board — for example, all components of your login flow.  
If your designs start to feel cluttered, move some elements to a new board to stay organized and focused.

You don’t want *every single design* on a separate board (too much switching!),  
but you also don’t want *everything crammed* into one messy board.  
Find the right balance between organization and convenience.
