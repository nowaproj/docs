Grouping widgets is a powerful way to **organize** and **manage** multiple widgets in your design.  
By grouping, you can move, align, and resize several widgets at once — saving time and keeping your layout clean and structured.

On this page, you’ll learn:
- What groups are and why they’re useful  
- How to group and ungroup widgets  
- What properties groups have

### What Are Groups?

A **Group** lets you combine multiple widgets into a single unit.  
This makes it easier to manipulate them together — whether you’re repositioning, aligning, or resizing elements.

For example, if you’re designing a card with an image, title, and button, grouping them keeps everything together so they move as one piece.

### Group Properties

Once you create a group, you can adjust several properties to fine-tune its layout and behavior:

**Alignment** — Controls how the widgets inside the group are positioned (e.g., center, top-left, bottom-right).  

**Text Direction** — Defines the order and direction in which child widgets are arranged, useful for text-based or sequential layouts.  

**Fit** — Determines how the group’s size adapts to its parent or children.  

**Children** — Lists all widgets contained within the group. You can also add new widgets directly here, and they’ll automatically become part of the group.
