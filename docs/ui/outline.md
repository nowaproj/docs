description: Learn how to use the Outline panel to manage, navigate, and organize your app’s layout easily.
---

The **Outline Panel** helps you visualize the full structure of your screen in a simple, tree-like view.  
You’ll find it in the **top-left corner** of the Design Board.

It lists every widget in your screen — arranged in a nested hierarchy — just like it would appear in Flutter code.  
This makes it easier to understand, navigate, and manage complex layouts without endlessly scrolling on the canvas.

## What the Outline Shows

### **Hierarchy of Widgets**
Every widget in your screen (Rows, Columns, Text, Buttons, GridViews, etc.) appears in order, showing how widgets are nested inside one another.

### **Visual Indicators**
The Outline uses helpful icons and colors to make it easier to understand your layout:
- A **yellow home icon** next to a screen’s name means it’s set as the **Home Screen**.  
- **Purple items** represent **Components**, helping you identify reusable widgets at a glance.

### **Containers and Children**
You can expand or collapse widgets to explore their child elements — such as nested rows, columns, or items inside grids.  
This is especially helpful when working with deeply nested UIs.

## Navigation and Actions

The Outline isn’t just for viewing — you can use it to navigate and manage your layout faster:

- **Double-click** on any widget in the Outline to instantly center it on the design board.  
- **Right-click** any item to open a **context menu** that lets you:
  - Remove or duplicate widgets  
  - Group or ungroup elements  
  - Convert a widget into a reusable **Component**  
  - Perform other quick layout actions — without leaving the Outline view.
