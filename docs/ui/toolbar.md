## What’s Inside the Toolbar

Each tool has a specific purpose. Here’s what you can find from left to right:

**Selection** — Lets you select elements on the board, such as screens, widgets, and components, by clicking on them.  

**Shape** — Allows you to draw a **Container widget** directly on your board.  

**Screen** — Creates new screens for your app.  
You can start with an **empty screen** or choose from a **template**.  

**Text** — Lets you draw a **Text widget** directly on your board.  

**Widget** — Opens the **Widget Picker**, where you can browse and add different widgets to your design.  

**Play** — Lets you instantly play and preview your selected screen to test both its design and functionality.
