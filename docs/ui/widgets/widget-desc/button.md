# Button

The **Button** widget lets users perform an action when pressed — such as navigating to another screen, submitting a form, or triggering logic.  
Buttons can be styled, disabled, and connected to dynamic actions or data.

To add a Button, open the **Widget Picker** and search for **Button**.

## ⚙️ Button Properties

Here’s what you can control inside the **Button** widget:

- **Enabled** → Turns the button on or off. When disabled, the button becomes dimmed and non-interactive.  
- **On Pressed** → Opens the Circuit editor to define what happens when the user taps or clicks the button.  
- **On Long Press** → Opens the Circuit editor for actions triggered by pressing and holding the button.  
- **On Hover** → Opens the Circuit editor for hover actions (useful for web and desktop).  
- **Button Style** → Connects the button to a predefined or custom theme style, controlling its shape, background color, padding, borders, and more.  
  This property is directly linked to your app’s theme. Learn more in [[Themes]].

### 💡 Tip

Buttons are one of the most interactive elements in any app.  
You can combine **visual customization** with **logic** to make them both beautiful and functional —  
for example, changing colors dynamically based on state, or disabling a button until a form is complete.
