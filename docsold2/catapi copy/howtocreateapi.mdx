# API Call and Data Model Creation

In this section, I’ll show you how to connect an **API to the UI without writing any code**, yet still generate real working code behind the scenes. ✨  

---

## 1️⃣ Creating the API Call  
First, I create the **API call** in the project. This will be the foundation for displaying data.  

:::note

You don’t need to provide the entire URL, since it’s part of a **collection**. It’s enough to set only the required endpoint.  

:::

<video src="/videos/api2/request/1.webm" controls width="100%" />

:::info

**Benefit:** Keeps the setup clean and modular — easier to maintain and reuse later. 🧹

## 2️⃣ Setting the URL  
Next, I configure the **endpoint URL**, which defines where the data comes from. 🌐  

<video src="/videos/api2/request/2.webm" controls width="100%" />

:::info

**Benefit:** Ensures the app always points to the correct source of truth for your data. 📡

## 3️⃣ Adding the Authorization Key  
For security, add the required **Authorization key** 🔑.  
This ensures the system can communicate with the API in an authenticated way.  

<video src="/videos/api2/request/3.webm" controls width="100%" />

:::info

**Benefit:** Protects sensitive data and keeps the app secure while accessing APIs. 🛡️

## 4️⃣ Testing and Generating the Data Model  
Then comes the **test run** ▶️.  
From the returned **JSON** response, a **data model** is automatically generated, making each field easy to use. 🧩  

<video src="/videos/api2/request/4.webm" controls width="100%" />



:::info

**Benefit:** Saves time by automatically mapping fields — no manual parsing needed. ⚡

## 5️⃣ Binding the Data Model to the Image Element  
Finally, I visually **bind the data model** to the **image element**.  
This happens entirely without coding — while in the background, real code is generated. 🎨✨  

<video src="/videos/api2/request/5.webm" controls width="100%" />

:::info

**Benefit:** Brings dynamic content to life instantly, while staying completely no-code. 🎉

## 🌟 Summary  
From now on, you can send requests quickly, securely, and with consistent JSON responses—plus you’ll enjoy endless cat pictures to brighten your day 🐱💖.
