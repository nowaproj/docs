For now, let's start using the Web version and create a cloud project

## Creating a New Project

As they say, every big project start with a very small step, so let's start by seeing how to create your first project

To start building with Nowa:

1. Click on **New Project**.
2. Select **Cloud**.
3. Enter a name for your project.
4. Wait a few moments while your project is created.

    <div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: 'calc(56.15079365079365% + 41px)', height: 0, width: '100%' }}>
      <iframe
        src="https://demo.arcade.software/6uDlwaxIpdOOKKKuJqnU?embed&embed_mobile=tab&embed_desktop=inline&show_copy_link=true"
        title="Arcade Flow (Sun Feb 16 2025)"
        frameBorder="0"
        loading="lazy"
        allowFullScreen
        allow="clipboard-write"
        style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%', colorScheme: 'light' }}
      />
    </div>

Your project is now ready to start!
