In this section, we will go quickly through the main panels that appears in Nowa after creating a project. 

The following demo will walk you through the panels, and show you how to quickly create a new screen next to the home screen, drop some widgets, and implement navigation functionality between the two screens

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: 'calc(56.15079365079365% + 41px)', height: 0, width: '100%' }}>
    <iframe

    title="Arcade Flow (Sun Feb 16 2025)"
    frameBorder="0"
    loading="lazy"
    allowFullScreen
    allow="clipboard-write"
    style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%', colorScheme: 'light' }}
    />
</div>
  

Now let's talk with slight more details about the panels that you saw in the above demo:

---

## **1. Details Panel**

The **Details Panel** provides information about the currently selected element in your project.

- If you select a **screen, component, or widget**, its properties and settings will appear here.
- If nothing is selected, you will see **board settings**, allowing you to:
    - Change the background color.
    - Toggle the grid display.

---

## **2. Outline Panel**

The **Outline Panel**, located on the left side, shows all the **screens and components** currently on the board.

- **Quick Navigation:** Double-click on any widget or screen to navigate to it instantly.
- **Right-Click Menu:** You can right-click on an element to see options like **Replace, Remove**, and more.

---

## **3. Files Panel**

Nowa follows a **file-based system** similar to a traditional Flutter project. The main files in your project are **Dart files (.dart)**, which are essential building blocks for Flutter apps.

### **File Structure Overview:**

- **lib/** â†’ Contains all the Dart files, including 
	- The **App Theme** and **Global States**.
- **boards/** â†’ Contains **Design Boards**, which are groups of related UI screens:
    - Example: You can create an **Auth Board** that includes **Login, Signup, and Forgot Password** screens, keeping the authentication flow organized.
    - Avoid adding too many screens to a single board to maintain clarity and efficiency.
- **assets/** â†’ Stores all project assets like:
    - **Images, Videos, Audio files, Rive, or Lottie animations**.

---

## **4. Toolbar**

The **Toolbar**, located at the top center, provides essential tools for UI building.

- Use the toolbar to:
    - Add a **new screen** or a pre-built component to the project, like an Audio Player
    - Open the **Widget Picker** to drop widgets or components onto the board.
    - Enter **Play Mode** to test a single screen or the entire app (if you are selecting a screen, the play mode will start from that screen. If nothing is selected, it will start from the Home screen)
    :::tip
    Select the Home screen by selecting the screen then in the details panel choose "Make Home Screen"
    :::

## **5. File Preview**

Each file, whether a **screen or component**, can be opened separately in **File Preview Mode** without the board.

This allows you to **focus on a single file** and switch to **code view** to view, write, or modify its Dart code. More on that later.

---

## **6. Circuit**

The **Circuit Panel** is Nowaâ€™s visual logic builder.

- It appears when you open a **function**, such as:
    - **Event functions**, like `OnPressed` (triggered when a button is clicked).
    - **Custom functions**, which you can create and define logic for. You can create functions inside a screen, component, or in a global state. More on that later

We will explore the **Circuit Panel** and other features in more detail in upcoming sections.

This concludes the quick tour of Nowaâ€™s main panels. Now that you have an overview of the UI, you're ready to start building your app! ðŸš€
