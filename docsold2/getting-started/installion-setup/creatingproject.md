# Projects: Local or Cloud?

When creating projects, you need to decide whether to store them locally or in the cloud.
Choosing between local and cloud development depends on the project’s needs.🙂

## 💻 Local Development  
- 🖥️ Best for using simulators and testing  
- 💾 Keeps files directly on your machine  
- ⚙️ Offers more control and works offline  
- 🔒 Ideal for sensitive data

## ☁️ Cloud Development

- 🤝 Enables easy collaboration  
- 🗄️ Stores files securely online  
- 🌍 Provides scalability and accessibility
