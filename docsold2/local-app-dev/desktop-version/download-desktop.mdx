## Why Use Nowa Desktop Version?

Using the Nowa Desktop version comes with several advantages that enhance your app development experience:

### 1. Enhanced Performance
**Native Execution:** The Desktop version runs natively on your device, which generally offers better performance compared to running Nowa in a web browser.

### 2. Local Flutter Projects
- **Local Project Creation:** With Nowa Desktop, you can create local Flutter projects that are stored directly on your device. This allows you to use your regular development workflow and favorite tools as if you were developing a pure Flutter app.
- **Maintain using your original workflow and tools beside Nowa:** Nowa doesn't force you to change how you usually work as a Flutter developer, instead it integrates smoothly to what you have been already using before.

You can continue using your preferred IDEs like VS Code, manage version control with GitHub (Check out how to [create Github repo out of your Nowa local project](../../version-cont-deploy/git/git-local.md)), and even utilize tools like GitHub Copilot. This is all due to the fact that Nowa projects are simply normal Flutter projects that you have locally, hence you can use the project folder itself to open it in VS code for example and in Nowa at the same time.

### 3. Simulators and Platforms
Nowa Desktop enables you to use simulators for Android, iOS, web, and desktop while building your app. This feature allows you to test and see real-time results across different platforms seamlessly.

### 4. Offline Capability
One of the key advantages of the Desktop version is the ability to work offline. You can continue building and editing your projects even without an internet connection, ensuring uninterrupted productivity.

:::note  
**Available for Everyone:** The Nowa Desktop version is available for all users. No premium subscription is required — just download, install, and start building.
