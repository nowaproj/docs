# Documentation Guidelines

## Clarity and Simplicity
- Use clear, straightforward language.  
- Avoid unnecessary jargon or long sentences.  
- Focus on conveying information directly.  

## Structured Layout
- Organize content into logical sections (introduction, prerequisites, steps, troubleshooting, summary).  
- Use headings, subheadings, and lists for readability.  
- Ensure consistent formatting throughout the document.  

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Present actions in a sequential order.  
2. Number each step clearly.  
3. At every step, state exactly what happens (e.g., “Click the Save button. The file will be stored in the selected folder.”).  

## Highlight User Actions
- Emphasize what the user must do: pressing a button, selecting an option, entering text, confirming a setting.  
- Describe expected results after each action.  
- Keep each instruction limited to one action per step.  

## Accuracy and Consistency
- Verify all instructions against the actual process.  
- Use consistent terminology for menus, buttons, or functions.  
- Update the documentation whenever the process changes.  

## Visual and Contextual Support (if needed)
- Add screenshots only when they clarify the text.  
- Label screenshots or diagrams clearly.  
- Avoid decorative elements; visuals must serve an instructional purpose.  

## Testing and Review
- Test the documentation by following the steps exactly as written.  
- Ask someone unfamiliar with the process to follow it and provide feedback.  
- Revise for clarity, completeness, and correctness.
