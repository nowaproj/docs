This is the `UI desinger` tool that opens first by default.

### Fast overview on the tools

On the end of the left side, you can see the drawing tools. You can create a `Screen`, a `Shape` or a `Text` by clicking one of them and then click on the location on the baord where you want to place them.

On the other hand, the Visual Programming window (`VPL`) is made to build the logic for the app. `Data` window is used to create API data requests.

### Create your first app

Lets a create a simple app with one screen and a text saying *(as you guessed it)* "Hello world". 

First create a new screen by selecting the `Screen` tool <img src="../img/images/9.PNG" height="25"/> from the drawing tools on the left side, then click on any empty place on the board to place the screen there.

To know more about screens, watch this video tutorial about [creating screens in Nowa ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwLJBUTm_jA).

Then, create a text by selecting the `Text` tool <img src="../img/images/13.PNG" height="25"/>
 from the drawing tools and click inside the screen to place it there, notice the outline where it shows you the layout of your screen.

To change the text, select the text widget, then on the right side, change the text using the field `text` in the details panel and make it "Hello world".

To play the app, you should tell Nowa first which is the first screen in your app. Select the screen and click on "Make home screen".
